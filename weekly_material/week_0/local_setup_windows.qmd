## Installing R

First, you will need to install R on your computer.

1.  Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com). You will need to select the Windows link, and then "base" link on the next page (circled below). Then click "Download R-X.X.X for Windows".

2.  In your downloads, double click to open the new file that starts with "**R-**" and ends in "**.exe**".

3.  Click through the various steps of the installer. You should be fine with the default options. This will complete the install of R.

## Installing RStudio

Next, you will need to install RStudio on your computer.

1.  Download RStudio Desktop from the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). *Reminder: RStudio and Posit are the same thing, RStudio the company is just in the process of being re-branded as Posit so you will see both names for now.*
2.  In your downloads, double click to open the new file that starts with "**RStudio**" and ends in "**.exe**".
3.  Click through the various steps of the installer. You should be fine with the default options. This will complete the install.

## Updating R and RStudio

If you are continuing to use R on your own computer, you will need to somewhat regularly update R and RStudio (every few months is a good goal). Updates to R are needed to maintain compatibility with package updates, and RStudio continues to regularly add new helpful features.

The easiest way to complete these updates is to just follow the above steps again, as if you didn't already have R and RStudio installed! *Note: If you are prompted, please select to "replace" the previous version of R and RStudio on your computer.*
